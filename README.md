# 💧 Improved Source of Drinking Water – AICTE Virtual Internship Project

This project was completed as part of the **AICTE Virtual Internship** in collaboration with **Edunet Foundation** and **IBM Cloud**, under the theme:  
**“Improved Source of Drinking Water”** — a real-world social challenge focused on data-driven policy insights.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Access to safe and improved drinking water remains a major challenge in India, especially in rural and underdeveloped areas. Despite ongoing efforts under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6), disparities still persist across states and socio-economic groups.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze the 78th Round of the **Multiple Indicator Survey (MIS)** dataset and uncover disparities in drinking water access, sector-wise trends, and related indicators like clean cooking fuel and migration patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🌐 IBM Cloud (Lite Plan)
- 🔎 IBM Watsonx.ai Studio (No-code data visualization)
- 📁 Dataset: National Sample Survey – 78th Round MIS (CSV format)
- 📊 Charts used: Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Histogram, Pareto Chart

---

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Upload** → Importing CSV into Watsonx.ai
2. **Data Preprocessing** → Handling nulls and formatting
3. **Visualization** → Creating graphs to analyze:
   - Sector-wise water access (Urban, Rural, All)
   - State-level disparities
   - Related variables (clean fuel, migration)
4. **Export** → Dashboard images used in final presentation

---

## 📈 Results

- Urban areas showed higher access to improved water sources than rural areas.
- Certain states had significantly low percentages of access.
- Pareto analysis revealed the top contributors to national water access inequality.
- Visualizations supported actionable insights for policy improvement.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis highlights regional disparities in water accessibility and the need for targeted interventions. Using IBM Watsonx.ai allowed for rapid no-code analytics, making data more accessible to non-programmers and decision-makers.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Incorporate real-time water quality and contamination data
- Use predictive modeling for water stress forecasting
- Integrate sanitation, health, and climate datasets
